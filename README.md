# Kaushal's Cybersecurity Portfolio

Hi, I’m **Kaushal**, a Year 2 Computer Science student at **National University of Singapore (NUS)**, exploring the intersection of **Blue Team engineering**, **cyber defense**, and **AI/agentic workflows**.

This repository is my **hands-on cybersecurity portfolio** – a collection of labs, writeups, and experiments where I:
- Recreate and study **common attack techniques**
- Build and tune **detection & monitoring pipelines**
- Practice **forensics and incident investigation**
- Prototype **AI- and agent-assisted workflows** for defenders

My goal is to grow into a strong **Blue Team / Detection Engineering / SOC** practitioner by doing real, end-to-end projects instead of just reading theory.

## What You'll Find Here

Each folder in this repo is a self-contained project with:
- A **short README** (overview, goals, tools, key takeaways)
- A **detailed writeup** (`writeup.md` or `writeup.pdf`)
- **Media** (screenshots, diagrams)
- Optionally, **artifacts** (pcaps, logs, configs) and **scripts**

Broad categories you’ll see as this repo grows:

- 🛡️ **Blue Team & Detection**
  - Endpoint monitoring labs (e.g. Sysmon, Wazuh, Windows telemetry)
  - Log analysis, rule writing, detection engineering experiments

- 🔴 **Offense-Informed Defense**
  - Small Red Team style labs used to generate realistic telemetry
  - Persistence, credential access, network-based attacks for learning how to detect and respond

- 🧪 **Network & Forensics**
  - PCAP analysis
  - Log forensics and timeline reconstruction
  - Investigation-style writeups

- 🤖 **AI & Agentic Workflows in Security**
  - Using LLMs and agents to:
    - Assist with triage, report drafting, and enrichment
    - Automate small parts of the defender workflow
  - Reflections on limitations and safe usage of AI in security work
